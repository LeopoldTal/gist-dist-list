# My favourite gists

Stuff I want pinned, but that are too short and too stable to be repos.

* [Matching words inside phone numbers](https://gist.github.com/LeopoldTal/92e89ea3d01857b327b27a64fb37d00c) with the [Aho-Corasick algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm) (Python) (TODO: consider making a viz of this)
* [Making a swimming pool out of cheese](https://gist.github.com/LeopoldTal/ceb164a1be41aca6c13e4afae254a671) (Javascript)
* ~~[Scraper for French government COVID-19 stats](https://gist.github.com/LeopoldTal/ff64601de455749a9d457b098a3da01f) (Python)~~ (~~TODO: consume [this csv](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/synthese-des-indicateurs-de-suivi-de-lepidemie-covid-19/#resources) instead~~) (The French government no longer provides covid data)
* [Mandelbrot set ASCII art](https://gist.github.com/LeopoldTal/2aa79947c4cab728402c4054d6733254) (C)
* [Cleanroom binary search challenge](https://gist.github.com/LeopoldTal/9713aecf4abb45c8515c95b913b017ab) from [The Reinvigorated Programmer](https://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/are-you-one-of-the-10-percent/) (Javascript); apparently I'm one of the 10%
* [Which elements have macroscopic chemical properties](https://gist.github.com/LeopoldTal/ddd0bc4853b90310a80ede90e83bb21d), vs existing only as nuclides? (TSV)
